About:
 slapt-update-service is a DBus service which notifies about package updates
 available via slapt-get and gslapt.  slapt-update-service places an icon in
 the user's notification area when updates are available.  Clicking the icon
 starts upgrading with gslapt.

Requirements:
 To build from source, you must have these packages mentioned in slack-required
 installed.

Building and installing:
  You can install via meson or autotools (deprecated).

  * Meson

      meson setup build # or any dir of your choosing
      meson compile -C build # or `ninja -C build` for older meson releases
      meson install -C build # or `ninja -C build install`  for older meson releases

      Meson/ninja supports `DESTDIR=/path meson install -C build`

      TIP:
      slapt-update-service.Slackbuild will create a Slackware package.
      Run with sudo or as a privileged user.

  * autotools (deprecated)

      ./autogen.sh # if building from git
      ./configure
      make
      make install # as privileged user

      The Makefile honors DESTDIR.

      TIP:
      `make pkg` (as privileged user) will create a Slackware package.
